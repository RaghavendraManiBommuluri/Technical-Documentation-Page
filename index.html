      Speech Recognition is an important feature in several applications used such as home automation, artificial intelligence, etc. This article aims to provide an introduction on how to make use of the SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 library of Python.
      <br>
      Installation required:<br><br>
      
          Python Speech Recognition module: <br>
      
          pip install speechrecognition <br>
      
          PyAudio: Use the following command for linux users<br>
      
          sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio<br>
      
          Windows users can install pyaudio by executing the following command in a terminal<br>
      
          pip install pyaudio<br>
      
          Python pyttsx3 module:<br>
      
          pip install pyttsx3<br><br>
      
      Speech Input Using a Microphone and Translation of Speech to Text<br><br>
      
          Allow Adjusting for Ambient Noise: Since the surrounding noise varies, we must allow the program a second or too to adjust the energy threshold of recording so it is adjusted according to the external noise level.
          Speech to text translation: This is done with the help of Google Speech Recognition. This requires an active internet connection to work. However, there are certain offline Recognition systems such as PocketSphinx, but have a very rigorous installation process that requires several dependencies. Google Speech Recognition is one of the easiest to use.
          <br>
      Translation of Speech to Text:
      
      <br><br>
      First, we need to import the library and then initialize it using init() function. This function may take 2 arguments.
      <br>
      init(driverName string, debug bool)
      <br><br>
          drivername: [Name of available driver] sapi5 on Windows | nsss on MacOS
          debug: to enable or disable debug output
          <br><br>
      After initialization, we will make the program speak the text using say() function.
      This method may also take 2 arguments.
      <br>
      say(text unicode, name string)
      <br><br>
          text: Any text you wish to hear.<br>
          name: To set a name for this speech. (optional)
          <br><br>
      Finally, to run the speech we use runAndWait() All the say() texts wonâ€™t be said unless the interpreter encounters runAndWait().

      <li><strong>Configure Microphone (For external microphones):</strong> It is advisable to specify the microphone during the program to avoid any glitches.<br />Type <strong>lsusb</strong> in the terminal. A list of connected devices will show up. The microphone name would look like this
      <pre>USB Device 0x46d:0x825: Audio (hw:1, 0)</pre>
      <p>Make a note of this as it will be used in the program.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Set Chunk Size: </strong>This basically involved specifying how many bytes of data we want to read at once. Typically, this value is specified in powers of 2 such as 1024 or 2048</li>
      <li><strong>Set Sampling Rate: </strong>Sampling rate defines how often values are recorded for processing</li>
      <li><strong>Set Device ID to the selected microphone</strong>: In this step, we specify the device ID of the microphone that we wish to use in order to avoid ambiguity in case there are multiple microphones. This also helps debug, in the sense that, while running the program, we will know whether the specified microphone is being recognized. During the program, we specify a parameter device_id. The program will say that device_id could not be found if the microphone is not recognized.</li>
      <li><strong>Allow Adjusting for Ambient Noise: </strong>Since the surrounding noise varies, we must allow the program a second or too to adjust the energy threshold of recording so it is adjusted according to the external noise level.</li>

    <header>Transcribe an Audio file to text</header>
    <p>
      If we have an audio file that we want to translate to text, we simply have to replace the source with the audio file instead of a microphone.
      Place the audio file and the program in the same folder for convenience. This works for WAV, AIFF, of FLAC files.
      An implementation has been shown below

    </p>
     <p>#Python 2.x program to transcribe an Audio file<br />import speech_recognition as sr<br /><br />AUDIO_FILE = ("example.wav")<br /><br /># use the audio file as the audio source<br /><br />r = sr.Recognizer()<br /><br />with sr.AudioFile(AUDIO_FILE) as source:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;#reads the audio file. Here we use record instead of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;#listen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;audio = r.record(source)<br /><br />try:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;print("The audio file contains: " + r.recognize_google(audio))<br /><br />except sr.UnknownValueError:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;print("Google Speech Recognition could not understand audio")<br /><br />except sr.RequestError as e:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;print("Could not request results from Google Speech<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Recognition service; {0}".format(e))<br /><br /></p>
